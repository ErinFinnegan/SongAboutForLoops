A All computer languages have loops,
B loops for what and while and when.
A Before your brain reboots,
B Let’s go over this again!

A First you initialize,
B then you check if your condition is true.
A Next you increment another step, your code amplifies!
B Is the condition still true?  It’s time to review!

A We’ve sung this song [zero] times before,
B For as long as we’ve sung it less than three times,
A We’ll sing this song, and sing it once more.
B Until we hit four, or run out of rhymes.

A Initialize! 
B Is the condition true?
A Take one step forward.
B Is the condition false? Then stop.


//Loops were probably invented by Ada Lovelace 
// For loops perhaps first appeared in ALGOL 60, short for ALGOrithmic Language, a programming language developed by European and American computer scientists

//Maybe a take on Henry the 8th song?
