Group:  Listen, listen, what’s your condition?
It:  Ten steps forward.
Group:  Have we gone ten steps?
It:  No. Not yet. Take one [more] step.

The call and response continues until It’s condition is met:

Group:  Listen, listen, what’s your condition?
It:  Ten steps forward.
Group:  Have we gone ten steps?
It:  Yes!  Now YOU’RE it!

It turns on the group and chases tags the next person who will be “It”.

Conditions may also be things like stepping backwards, raising an arm or finger, or having children sit down one at a time until everyone is seated:

Group:  Listen, listen! what’s your condition?
It:  Everyone sits down, one at a time.
Group:  Are we all sitting down?
It:  No. Not yet. You (points at someone) sit down!
