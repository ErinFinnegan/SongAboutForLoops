Notes about for loops:

Loops were probably invented by Ada Lovelace 
For loops perhaps first appeared in ALGOL 60, short for ALGOrithmic Language, a programming language developed by European and American computer scientists

Shiffman on for loops:  https://vimeo.com/channels/introcompmedia/71904715

As always, his videos are charming, but not necessarily clear to outsiders.

...as far as I can tell, there are four steps to explain here:

1. Initialize
2. Test - Check the condition
3. Update, Iterate, increment
4. Exit Condition is met, so leave the loop

Here are some other links about for loops:

A very good explanation:

^^^
“For” loops are used for known conditions, and “while” loops are used for unknown conditions.
