Notes about for loops:

Shiffman on for loops:  https://vimeo.com/channels/introcompmedia/71904715

As always, his videos are charming, but not necessarily clear to outsiders.

...as far as I can tell, there are four steps to explain here:

1. Initialize
2. Test - Check the condition
3. Update, Iterate, increment
4. Exit Condition is met, so leave the loop
